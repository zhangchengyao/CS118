# CS118  
## 1 Goal  
In this project, we are going to develop a Web server in C/C++. Also, we will take the chance to learn a little bit more about how the Web browser and server work behind the scene.  
## 2 Lab Working Environment  
You need a plain-text editor to create the source code You may use vim/emacs/nano in Unix/Linux systems. Since C/C++ is a cross-platform language, you should be able to compile and run your code on any machine with C/C++ compiler and BSD socket library installed.  
We recommend you develop and test your code in Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (Xenial Xerus). You may obtain a copy of Ubuntu 16.04.3 from its official website (http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/, 64-bit PC AMD64 desktop image) and install in VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org) or other similar VM platforms. SEASnet linux servers are also accepted for testing. However, the OS you use must have a Web browser that ships with a graphical interface for testing. We do not support Windows workstations for Project 1 because of its different socket programming convention and behaviors. Use of macOS is allowed but not encouraged, since TAs may not provide support for OS-related issues other than Linux.
